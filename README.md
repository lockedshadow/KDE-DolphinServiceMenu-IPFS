# KDE-DolphinServiceMenu-IPFS

A context menu helper for Dolphin file manager to add files into IPFS through local IPFS node and obtain shareable link to added file.

It forked from https://github.com/amar-laksh/KDE-DolphinServiceMenu-IPFS, but rewritten in Python for reach ability to implement some [advanced features](./Planning.md). At this moment, it operates nearly the same way as original does, except using local IPFS node instead globalupload.io and some minor changes.
