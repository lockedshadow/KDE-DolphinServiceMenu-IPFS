# KDE-DolphinServiceMenu-IPFS

A context menu helper for Dolphin file manager to add files into IPFS through local IPFS node and obtain shareable link to added file.

It forked from https://github.com/amar-laksh/KDE-DolphinServiceMenu-IPFS, but rewritten in Python for reach ability to implement some advanced features. At this moment, it operates nearly the same way as original does, except using local IPFS node instead globalupload.io and some minor changes.

### Dependencies

- Python ≥3.5
- [py-ipfs-api](https://github.com/ipfs/py-ipfs-api)
- kdialog (part of KDE Applications)
