A tentative list of planned features:
----------

- Allow to add multiple files at once;
- Allow to add directories
- - with/without hidden files;
- Option to use IPFS Files API and store all added files within specific location;
- Use kconfig to store options;
- Option to use filestore instead of adding files into IPFS datastore;
- Option to select CIDv0/CIDv1;
- Multiple upload options: through local IPFS node or certain public writable gateway;
- Selectable local node address and port;
- ...maybe something else?
